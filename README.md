Customer Churn Prediction App

This is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on various input features. The app uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model and pre-processing objects (label encoder, one-hot encoder, and scaler) to make predictions.

Features
Interactive user interface to input customer details such as Geography, Gender, Age, Balance, Credit Score, etc.
Predicts churn probability and provides a simple "likely to churn" or "not likely to churn" interpretation.
Built with Python, Streamlit, TensorFlow, and Pandas.
